# Chasum — Current Project State

**READ FIRST.** Sole current program board; no separate `CURRENT_STATE.md`.  
**Snapshot date:** 2026-09-29. **Updated by:** Chasum development team for M1B Production acceptance closeout (merge 2026-09-30 UTC / 2026-09-29 Toronto). M1A and M1B are closed; the broader GVM technician mobile-correction program remains open.
**Repository:** `renovisionai2-cloud/chasum`. Values below are dated observations; freshly query remote main/runtime before consequential work.

## Chasum mission

Chasum is being built to become **THE WORLD'S MOST INTELLIGENT AI-POWERED BUSINESS OPERATING SYSTEM FOR SERVICE-BASED BUSINESSES.**

It is **not** merely booking software, scheduling software, a CRM, payment software, an AI receptionist or a chatbot.

Connected operating chain:

Customer → Booking → Appointment → Staff → Location → Service → Payment → Invoice → Receipt → Communication → Follow-up → Reporting → Automation → Summer Intelligence.

Every meaningful product decision should strengthen this operating system.

## Permanent Product Owner principle

**CHASUM ADAPTS TO HOW THE BUSINESS OPERATES. THE BUSINESS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO REORGANIZE ITSELF TO FIT CHASUM.**

**GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE NOW. REGIONAL ACTIVATION DELIBERATELY.** Architecture must support differing operating models globally without requiring every regional capability to be activated before launch.

No tenant-specific application logic is authorized.

## Control board

**M1B — All-Locations Booking Location Guard (Issue #120): PRODUCTION ACCEPTED / CLOSED / COMPLETED.** PR #122 squash-merged at `2026-09-30T00:21:41Z` as `3ac31c1a58732b8c3c4c34ef04ac19c7522565c0` (2026-09-29 Toronto). Merge tree `6d6097ad975b86e685ec161a82b742bb77e7f92b`; parent `e729dea51ad4888736d09cda705bd317dc6a1055`. Production deployment `dpl_AQDXaFxkSjJ4c2oX1CBZAjAk9jyX` is **READY / SUCCESS**, target `production`, unique URL `https://chasum-gb94c8tba-renovisionappcom.vercel.app`.

Direct Production `/api/build-info` HTTP 200: `commit=3ac31c1a58732b8c3c4c34ef04ac19c7522565c0`, `commitShort=3ac31c1`, `env=production`, `ref=main`, `production=true`. Direct `/api/health` HTTP 200: `ok=true`, `production=true`; `supabase=true`, `serviceRole=true`, `email=configured`, `cronSecret=configured`, `sms=optional_missing`, `stripe=optional_missing`, `sentry=optional_missing`, `softSchemaFallbacks=disabled`. Health proves configuration presence only, not active DB binding, provider delivery or worker execution. Public `/`, `/pricing`, `/status`, `/login`, `/book/gvm-baby-world` returned HTTP 200; `/status` rendered Operational. Merge-SHA Quality: **172 test files passed / 1 integration file skipped; 1,693 tests passed / 36 skipped / 0 failed**.

Authenticated real-GVM acceptance used existing account `gvmbabyworld@gmail.com` in the correct GVM Baby World tenant. Burlington, Brampton, Caledonia and All locations were visible. The operator deliberately switched Brampton → All locations; normal reload confirmed ALL persisted. A fresh Booking Sheet had empty Location / “Choose a location”, explicit Burlington/Brampton/Caledonia choices, Service and Employee disabled / “Choose a location first”, and Confirm appointment disabled. No customer, service, staff or time was chosen; no booking was created. The empty sheet was closed, workspace restored to **GVM Baby World Ultrasound Brampton**, and normal reload confirmed Brampton persisted, ALL no longer selected, Booking Sheet closed.

No Production tenant/database mutation, migration/schema/RLS/Auth/provider change or rollback occurred. Only operator workspace-scope cookie/UI state changed temporarily and was restored. Production DB counts were not queried for this spot-check. These are supplied accepted closeout observations; this documentation restamp performs no environment probe or action.

Competitive Product Gate for this restamp: **NOT_APPLICABLE** — documentation-only reconciliation of accepted facts; no product/strategy change.

**2026-09-29 M1A — Mobile Workspace Scope Control:** **PRODUCTION ACCEPTED / CLOSED.** PR #118 merged to `main` as `2733729ebbf65442cf55eb53b4962aa672535617` on 2026-09-29T00:28:22Z. Exact hosted-tested runtime candidate: `26a4b328ea2b7de1fbf70cc3c28aa1ce23c24329`; documentation-only closeout parent: `3784c781b878107fa6da7628f837e50f33bdfb45`. The Production squash tree `cdce0b0b8425672bd9361563b20bb4fa6035d0f4` is byte-identical to the docs-closeout tree, and every non-Markdown path is mechanically identical to the hosted-tested runtime candidate. Automatic Vercel Production deployment `dpl_3gC2c7oAfXGdXJ4avdNpfPH7daT5` completed successfully; `/api/build-info` returned the exact merge SHA on `main`, `env=production`, `production=true`; `/api/health` returned HTTP 200 / `ok=true`; Quality on the exact Production SHA passed **1,665 / 36 skipped / 0 failed**, including the real-Chromium containment test. Real GVM Production remained intact and no Production data mutation or manufactured booking occurred. Claude Opus 5 High Development Control Tower verdict: **B — PRODUCTION ACCEPTED / M1A CLOSED, WITH NON-BLOCKING LIMITATIONS**. No rollback and no further Production probe are required.

**The original GVM technician mobile program remains OPEN.** M1A is only the first bounded correction. Accepted milestone and remaining approved sequence:
- **M1B — All-Locations Booking Location Guard:** CLOSED / PRODUCTION ACCEPTED.
- **Issue #121 — Summer Location Disclosure:** Product Owner approved / competitive PASS / implementation not started; next bounded display-only slice.
- **M1C — Mobile Account Control:** required.
- **M2A — Reception Phone Composition:** required.
- **M2B — Calendar Phone Progressive Disclosure:** required.
- **M3 — Command Centre: Up Next Across Your Business:** approved/in scope; final launch classification at exact candidate.
- **M4 — Assign Later Level-3 Architecture/Data-Integrity Program:** required before truthful Unassigned / Assign Later support.
- **M5 — Summer Operating Intelligence:** design for now / build later.

Commercial SaaS Gate B / P2B remains paused and preserved while the Product Owner intentionally continues the mobile correction program. Do not reinterpret M1A closure as permission to resume P2B or as completion of the mobile program.

Deployment `dpl_AQDXaFxkSjJ4c2oX1CBZAjAk9jyX` READY/SUCCESS; exact direct build identity, health and real-GVM acceptance above. |
| Prior accepted application release | M1A PR #118 `2733729ebbf65442cf55eb53b4962aa672535617` remains Production accepted / closed; preceding PR #114 `d2820c26238b98420f6942958743ba46ca8a54f5` remains accepted. |
| Issue #102 multi-location readiness truth | **CLOSED / PRODUCTION ACCEPTED** (2026-09-26). Converged Command Centre, Services, Employees, Reception, Booking Sheet and public booking onto one relationship truth; removed the legacy `services.location_id` Command Centre reader; removed the permissive "Staff with null `location_id` works everywhere" fallback; added `getLocationBookingReadiness()` four-state model; raised shared modal Sheet above persistent mobile navigation. Historical #102 precedence: existing appointment → explicit draft → active workspace → user preference → Business default. M1B supersedes fresh-booking fallback: multi-location ALL requires explicit Location; saved appointment/draft truth and sole-active behavior remain. |
| GVM Production relationship-data correction | **COMPLETE / ACCEPTED** (2026-09-26). Separate governed Production DATA action, distinct from the software release. See the multi-location operating model below and the [Environment Manifest](runtime/ENVIRONMENT_MANIFEST.md) `GVM-DATA-2026-09-26` record. |
| Stage 1C database release | Exact migration `20260922210000_issue_81_stage_1c_location_template.sql`, Git blob `748e9d0f6dd9d5796839b6a234222593d2f25bc2`, SHA-256 `6a4e3285382d1d1fbd9592af70ec1e2476ac8c9bec28cd0ba6a0e3287b3cb98f`, applied/accepted on Staging and Production. Production ledger: `20260923135852 / issue_81_stage_1c_location_template`. 034–036 remain unapplied. |
| Phase 5 | **COMPLETE.** Genuine GVM Production booking + customer confirmation + business new-booking email acceptance remains closed. Do not manufacture replacement Production tests. |
| Current program phase | **Bounded Summer #121 Location Disclosure pre-build/implementation gate.** M1B closed; #121 Product Owner approved / competitive PASS / implementation not started. Later mobile slices not started; P2B paused. |
| Slice 0A / PR #105 | **COMPLETE / MERGED / Production verified** per live PO/supervisor dispatch. Base `7a3a62c6c0bae9358e43cc647a02f20df5d65372`; quality check **REQUIRED** (integration `15368`). Do not reopen #105 or PR #3/#13/#16. |
| Issue #106 / PR #107 pricing | **COMPLETE / Production accepted at `1b11ade`**, per PO/supervisor dispatch. Locked CAD presentation below remains accepted; separate commercial terms/activation are not inferred. |
| PR #111 / P2A | **Independently accepted; still Draft at `dbdcfea`.** Preserve candidate and review; no code imported into #113. |
| Issue #112 / P2B preparation | **PAUSED / PRESERVED.** Existing evidence/approvals remain intact, but the Product Owner has explicitly directed the active continuation to the mobile program after M1A closeout. Do not resume P2B automatically. |
| Issue #81 multi-location Stage 1 | **COMPLETE / PRODUCTION ACCEPTED.** Stage 1A Business Service Catalog, Stage 1B Service/Staff/location/public-booking convergence and Stage 1C atomic Add Location snapshot/template workflow are live. Issue #102 completed the remaining Stage-1 read-model convergence without rewriting this accepted history. |
| Location entitlement | Canonical application/Stage-1C limits: starter 1 / professional 3 / business 6 / enterprise unlimited. GVM remains a normal Starter tenant with 3 existing Locations grandfathered; `can_add_location=false` until entitlement changes. Historical Phase-5 source/seed material still contains Business=10 while later accepted app/Stage-1C truth is 6; track that source/history divergence separately and do not change entitlement behavior inside M1A. |
| Observability / Issue #65 | **COMPLETE / CLOSED.** Production Sentry remains OFF. |
| Issue #72 tenant identity | **CLOSED / PRODUCTION ACCEPTED.** Do not reopen absent contradictory evidence. |
| Issue #73 governed switching/import | **CLOSED / COMPLETED** (2026-09-25). Package A, B1, staff quota, B2 core, C1, C2 and C3 are all complete; Package C released to Production via PR #100 (`93a4fc13bed2fb2bf6cb00ead8050878aad1adb9`). Do not resume C2 or C3 preflight work — the prior "Package C2 READ-ONLY preflight" next-action is superseded and was removed from this board on 2026-09-26. |
| Issue #57 branded Production domain | **OPEN but DEFERRED** by accepted Product Owner decision `5745462206` (2026-09-19). `https://chasum.vercel.app` remains the Private Alpha Production hostname; `https://staging.chasumai.com` remains Staging. A partial Vercel-side apex/`www` attachment was recorded before the stop; GoDaddy DNS, Supabase Auth Site URL, Production `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and redeploy were NOT changed. Do not resume without the Product Owner reversing the deferral. |
| Main-branch governance | Ruleset `23730556`: PR required; required checks are Vercel + competitive-product-gate + quality (integration `15368`, per PO/supervisor dispatch); strict/up-to-date; force-push/deletion blocked; `required_approving_review_count=0`; `required_review_thread_resolution=true`. PR #105 provides the Node 22 unit-test/typecheck quality workflow; this clone uses Node 26.7.0. |
| Competitive Product Gate | Permanent for material customer/operator features. |
| Known product gap | **Employee "Assigned locations" persistence path — IMPORTANT BUT POST-LAUNCH SAFE.** See below. |
| Deferred / design-for-now | Stage 2 location overrides, Stage 3 live inheritance, bulk multi-location assignment controls, resource-aware booking, durable Summer action provenance, true employee RBAC, tenant switcher, Production Sentry activation, native apps, branded domain (Issue #57), residual historical security/migration debt when specifically scoped. |
| Known non-blocking debt | PR #105 closed the two stale test assertions and established required quality CI. Local #113 comparison: 29 pre-existing lint errors and 8 warnings, including `quick-appointment.tsx` / `sheet.tsx`; the new Next lint rule adds two warnings for existing internal `window.location.href` navigation (`app/global-error.tsx:54`, `components/day-view/appointment-drawer.tsx:370`); a 36px Employee-profile control below the Chasum ≥40px touch floor. |
| Dependency findings / pending triage | **#109 residual analysis OPEN.** Dated baseline: 25 npm package entries (3 low / 8 moderate / 13 high / 1 critical), omit-dev 9 (0 / 2 / 6 / 1). #113 candidate: 22 (3 / 8 / 11 / 0), omit-dev 5 (0 / 2 / 3 / 0). Next no longer appears in the candidate audit; Momentic sharp 0.35.3 and other residuals remain. These are package entries, not independent CVEs or proof of exposure/compromise. September 30 release check is future follow-up, not installed or scheduled. |
| Exact next substantive gate | **Issue #121 bounded display-only implementation on current main, under recorded Competitive Product Gate PASS.** Display existing option Location on every Summer booking option and successful confirmation; see approved boundary below. |
| Product Owner input | Explicit approval of M1B merge / Production rollout was executed and accepted. Prior #121 approval and pre-build competitive PASS stand. This task authorizes only the five-file documentation restamp, no implementation or environment action. |

**Issue #106 locked pricing (CAD):** Standard Professional 79/month or 790/year; Business 149/month or 1,490/year. First 25 businesses signing up for Alpha: fixed lifetime recurring Professional 59/month or 590/year; Business 129/month or 1,290/year. Annual totals are paid upfront for 12 months. “Pay for 10 months and receive 2 months free.” Leading offer: “Save twice: lifetime Alpha pricing, plus two months FREE when you pay annually.” First saving at monthly rates: 240/year on either plan; additional Alpha annual saving: 118/258; combined savings vs 12 regular monthly payments: 358/498. Monthly Alpha alone does not include the two free months. Same product/entitlements; no checkout, assignment or runtime catalog change. Competitive gate REQUIRED, pre-build source: Issue #106 comment `5848862526`.

GVM Baby World and Chasum HQ remain normal tenants. Platform Admin / Control Centre remains a separate protected SaaS control plane at `/owner`; Chasum HQ is **not** Platform Admin.

## Permanent multi-tenant multi-location operating model

Governing architecture. GVM exposed the problem; **GVM is not the architecture.**

```
BUSINESS                → LOCATIONS
BUSINESS SERVICE CATALOG→ each Service may be offered at ONE / SOME / ALL Locations
STAFF                   → each Staff member may work at ONE / SOME / ALL Locations
STAFF ↔ SERVICE         → each Staff member may provide ONE / SOME / ALL Services
```

**Bookability at a selected Location requires all of:** Service offered there; Staff permitted to work there; Staff provides that Service; applicable hours / availability / operating rules.

- `service_locations` = offered-at operating truth. `staff_locations` = works-at operating truth. `staff_services` = provides operating truth. **Relationship tables carry operating truth.**
- Home/default Location is metadata/default behavior. It must **NOT** automatically mean "Staff can only work here."
- Primary/legacy Service Location (`services.location_id`) is metadata/compatibility state. It must **NOT** automatically mean "Service can only be offered here."
- Readiness is modelled in four states by `lib/booking/location-readiness.ts`: `no-services`, `no-staff`, `no-service-staff-overlap`, `ready`. Each names the actual missing relationship rather than showing a generic setup failure.

## Next bounded slice — Issue #121

**Issue #121 — Summer: disclose booking Location before confirmation. PRODUCT OWNER APPROVED / PRE-BUILD COMPETITIVE PRODUCT GATE PASS / IMPLEMENTATION NOT STARTED. LAUNCH REQUIRED.** Next substantive gate is bounded display-only implementation on current main under the recorded competitive PASS: display the already-populated Location name on every Summer booking option and on successful booking confirmation.

Preflight source truth supplied for current main: `SummerBookingOption` has `locationId` and optional `locationName`; `lib/summer/tools.ts` already populates `locationName` from `knowledge.locations`; `components/summer/summer-reception-workspace.tsx` does not render it on option cards, and the confirmation banner does not separately disclose the selected option Location. Preferred architecture is UI-only using the already-selected option object; no Summer UI regression currently protects this.

Approved boundary: no orchestrator, Summer tools behavior, AI reasoning/prompt, Location-selection or booking-engine mutation-semantics change; no DB/schema/migration. Location selection under ALL remains M5 / Summer ACT-safety; Summer is not guarded by M1B. The recorded competitive principles are Jane’s explicit multi-location selection and booking/notification Location disclosure, and Fresha’s explicit Location in calendar workflow; do not copy competitors. Chasum’s advantage is deterministic Location from the exact option being submitted, never AI-generated Location prose. Launch rationale: Summer can cause a real booking mutation, so hiding the target branch before human confirmation risks multi-location operational trust.

Sequence: **M1B CLOSED → #121 → M1C → M2A → M2B → M3 → M4 → M5**. No #121 or #123 implementation is part of this restamp; M1C/M2A/M2B/M3/M4/M5 have not started. #123 — remove inert booking `preferenceLocationId` plumbing — remains **OPEN / POST-M1B SAFE / not an M1B blocker**. P2B remains paused; migrations 034–036 remain unapplied.

## Summer — AI Business Manager

Summer is the AI Business Manager / intelligence layer, maturing through:

**UNDERSTAND → EXPLAIN → RECOMMEND → ACT safely with permission → AUDIT → later AUTOMATE SAFELY → later OPERATE PROACTIVELY.**

Do not bolt an AI label onto conventional SaaS. Architect deterministic operating truth so Summer can safely operate across it.

For multi-location specifically: UNDERSTAND / EXPLAIN / RECOMMEND are now supported by explicit relationship truth and readiness states. **ACT remains constrained by the Employee assigned-location persistence gap below** — a deterministic additive write path is a prerequisite for Summer ACT on multi-location, not merely operator convenience.

## Permanent World-Class Standard

Durable Chasum acceptance lens. **Do not copy these products.**

| Reference | Quality Chasum must match |
| --- | --- |
| Apple | simplicity / clarity / polish |
| Stripe | truth / reliability / financial confidence |
| Linear | speed / hierarchy / efficient workflows |
| Notion | flexibility / adaptable business structure |
| OpenAI | intelligence |
| Framer | visual quality |
| Calendly | scheduling simplicity |
| Jane | workflow trust / usability |
| Fresha / Vagaro | operational breadth |

Standing question: **"If a mature service business sees Chasum beside its existing software, why does Chasum feel like an upgrade?"**

Hard principle: **passing tests means technically credible. It does NOT by itself mean world class.** Always ask both *"Does it work safely?"* **and** *"Would a real business prefer this experience to the mature software it already uses?"*

## Known product gap — Employee "Assigned locations" persistence

**Classification: IMPORTANT BUT POST-LAUNCH SAFE.** Recorded, not scheduled. Do not implement without authorization.

The Employee profile already contains an **"Assigned locations"** multi-select, pre-checked from current assignments. The problem is its persistence path in `lib/actions/employees.ts`:

- destructive delete-and-reinsert of `staff_locations`;
- destructive replacement behavior around `staff_services` in the same save flow;
- can write `staff.location_id`, i.e. can move home/default Location.

This creates safety and clarity risk. Genuinely additive actions exist but are unreachable for existing Staff at existing Locations: `assignStaffToLocation()` is reachable only from the Add Location dialog, and the additive path in `lib/actions/staff.ts` only runs on employee creation. The Services side is already correct — `enableServiceAtLocation()` is additive, idempotent and tenant-validated.

Likely future direction: make the existing control safely additive / explicit-remove rather than delete-all-and-reinsert; separate operating truth from home/default metadata clearly; design one deterministic write path that future bulk multi-location controls **and** Summer ACT can reuse.

## World-class UX observations to preserve

**Strength.** Chasum distinguishes `no-services`, `no-staff`, `no-service-staff-overlap` and `ready`, and explains the actual missing relationship rather than showing a generic setup failure.

**Gap.** Steady-state multi-location relationship truth is less visible once everything is configured — the model is mostly taught through empty states. The Employee profile also risks conceptual ambiguity between **Primary location**, **Default location** and **Assigned locations**; the operating/bookability truth must eventually be clearer.

These are observations, not authorized feature work.

## Major-chapter re-anchor

The World-Class / Mission / Summer / Competitive re-anchor should occur **ONCE PER MAJOR CHASUM CHAPTER** at the appropriate governing point. Do not repeatedly rerun broad strategic or competitor analysis every few hours.

Re-open the strategic review only when: new contradictory evidence appears; implementation materially diverges from the accepted contract; relevant competitive evidence is materially stale; or the Product Owner explicitly reconsiders a locked decision.

This preserves strategic consistency without creating development paralysis.

## Agent governance — current model

Do not blindly restore historical agent assignments if they are stale.

- **Darshan** — Founder / CEO / Product Owner.
- **ChatGPT** — coordinator / continuity / Product Owner decision preparation / source-of-truth reconciliation, beneath Darshan.
- **Claude** — Development Control Tower for the current mobile workflow: architecture reconciliation, risk/gate judgment and high-risk review.
- **Codex** — Primary Engineering Implementer.
- **Grok** — World-Class Product / Architecture Challenger.
- **Independent audit** — assigned separately according to risk.

One primary implementer per task. Codex remains the primary implementer; the current PO-locked assignment supersedes historical Control Tower wording. Live GitHub/repository/runtime truth remains authoritative over stale handoffs. Closed/accepted work stays closed absent contradictory evidence.

## Continue without reconstructing history

Read [Latest Handoff](handoffs/LATEST_HANDOFF.md), then [Environment Manifest](runtime/ENVIRONMENT_MANIFEST.md), then live GitHub Issues/PRs. Current GitHub/runtime evidence wins over stale handoff text.

**Size budget:** keep this board short; move history, not decisions, elsewhere.
