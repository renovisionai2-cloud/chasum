# Chasum — Current Project State

**READ FIRST.** Sole current program board; no separate `CURRENT_STATE.md`.  
**Snapshot date:** 2026-09-26. **Updated by:** Claude Opus Development Control Tower for Issue #102 Production acceptance, the accepted GVM relationship-data correction and the bounded continuity closeout restamp.
**Repository:** `renovisionai2-cloud/chasum`. Values below are dated observations; freshly query remote main/runtime before consequential work.

## Chasum mission

Chasum is being built to become **THE WORLD'S MOST INTELLIGENT AI-POWERED BUSINESS OPERATING SYSTEM FOR SERVICE-BASED BUSINESSES.**

It is **not** merely booking software, scheduling software, a CRM, payment software, an AI receptionist or a chatbot.

Connected operating chain:

Customer → Booking → Appointment → Staff → Location → Service → Payment → Invoice → Receipt → Communication → Follow-up → Reporting → Automation → Summer Intelligence.

Every meaningful product decision should strengthen this operating system.

## Permanent Product Owner principle

**CHASUM ADAPTS TO HOW THE BUSINESS OPERATES. THE BUSINESS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO REORGANIZE ITSELF TO FIT CHASUM.**

**GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE NOW. REGIONAL ACTIVATION DELIBERATELY.** Architecture must support differing operating models globally without requiring every regional capability to be activated before launch.

No tenant-specific application logic is authorized.

## Control board

| Control field | Current record |
| --- | --- |
| Project / product position | Chasum — world-class AI Business Operating System for service businesses. See mission above. |
| Latest accepted behavior-changing application release | `934fe4c2d93f165f1b03189995f97ea2b32b8f4b` — PR #103 Issue #102 squash merge. Vercel Production deployment `J6UTXrUeV4YjxRUfQU5hpAydBCe9` SUCCESS; direct `/api/build-info` confirmed this exact SHA on `main`, `env=production`, `production=true`; `/api/health` `ok=true` byte-identical to the pre-merge baseline. Later documentation-only merges may advance Git/serving SHA without changing application behavior; freshly query main/runtime before consequential work. |
| Latest accepted Production release | **Issue #102 / PR #103 — MERGED + STAGING + PRODUCTION ACCEPTED.** Audited candidate `af535ec9f1e86af0da59c7e199218af26a24a134`; hosted-accepted parent `5421facf97da019a1e2b375a541f25877145d6ef`; squash merge `934fe4c2d93f165f1b03189995f97ea2b32b8f4b`. The merge commit's Git tree hash is byte-identical to the audited candidate (`4fd479460dd98a8a99a780d6ae182d2521b96972`). No migration, SQL, schema or RLS change. |
| Issue #102 multi-location readiness truth | **CLOSED / PRODUCTION ACCEPTED** (2026-09-26). Converged Command Centre, Services, Employees, Reception, Booking Sheet and public booking onto one relationship truth; removed the legacy `services.location_id` Command Centre reader; removed the permissive "Staff with null `location_id` works everywhere" fallback; added `getLocationBookingReadiness()` four-state model; raised shared modal Sheet above persistent mobile navigation. Booking Location precedence: existing appointment → explicit draft → active workspace → user preference → Business default. |
| GVM Production relationship-data correction | **COMPLETE / ACCEPTED** (2026-09-26). Separate governed Production DATA action, distinct from the software release. See the multi-location operating model below and the [Environment Manifest](runtime/ENVIRONMENT_MANIFEST.md) `GVM-DATA-2026-09-26` record. |
| Stage 1C database release | Exact migration `20260922210000_issue_81_stage_1c_location_template.sql`, Git blob `748e9d0f6dd9d5796839b6a234222593d2f25bc2`, SHA-256 `6a4e3285382d1d1fbd9592af70ec1e2476ac8c9bec28cd0ba6a0e3287b3cb98f`, applied/accepted on Staging and Production. Production ledger: `20260923135852 / issue_81_stage_1c_location_template`. 034–036 remain unapplied. |
| Phase 5 | **COMPLETE.** Genuine GVM Production booking + customer confirmation + business new-booking email acceptance remains closed. Do not manufacture replacement Production tests. |
| Current program phase | **Outside Private Alpha readiness — no open governed engineering work item.** See next gate below. |
| Issue #81 multi-location Stage 1 | **COMPLETE / PRODUCTION ACCEPTED.** Stage 1A Business Service Catalog, Stage 1B Service/Staff/location/public-booking convergence and Stage 1C atomic Add Location snapshot/template workflow are live. Issue #102 completed the remaining Stage-1 read-model convergence without rewriting this accepted history. |
| Location entitlement | Canonical live limits: starter 1 / professional 3 / business 6 / enterprise unlimited. GVM remains a normal Starter tenant with 3 existing Locations grandfathered; `can_add_location=false` until entitlement changes. Existing GVM rows were not rewritten by Stage 1C or by the Issue #102 correction. |
| Observability / Issue #65 | **COMPLETE / CLOSED.** Production Sentry remains OFF. |
| Issue #72 tenant identity | **CLOSED / PRODUCTION ACCEPTED.** Do not reopen absent contradictory evidence. |
| Issue #73 governed switching/import | **CLOSED / COMPLETED** (2026-09-25). Package A, B1, staff quota, B2 core, C1, C2 and C3 are all complete; Package C released to Production via PR #100 (`93a4fc13bed2fb2bf6cb00ead8050878aad1adb9`). Do not resume C2 or C3 preflight work — the prior "Package C2 READ-ONLY preflight" next-action is superseded and was removed from this board on 2026-09-26. |
| Issue #57 branded Production domain | **OPEN but DEFERRED** by accepted Product Owner decision `5745462206` (2026-09-19). `https://chasum.vercel.app` remains the Private Alpha Production hostname; `https://staging.chasumai.com` remains Staging. A partial Vercel-side apex/`www` attachment was recorded before the stop; GoDaddy DNS, Supabase Auth Site URL, Production `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and redeploy were NOT changed. Do not resume without the Product Owner reversing the deferral. |
| Main-branch governance | Ruleset `23730556`: PR required; required checks are Vercel + competitive-product-gate; strict/up-to-date; force-push/deletion blocked; `required_approving_review_count=0`; `required_review_thread_resolution=true`. There is **no** unit-test/typecheck/lint check on PRs. |
| Competitive Product Gate | Permanent for material customer/operator features. |
| Known product gap | **Employee "Assigned locations" persistence path — IMPORTANT BUT POST-LAUNCH SAFE.** See below. |
| Deferred / design-for-now | Stage 2 location overrides, Stage 3 live inheritance, bulk multi-location assignment controls, resource-aware booking, durable Summer action provenance, true employee RBAC, tenant switcher, Production Sentry activation, native apps, branded domain (Issue #57), residual historical security/migration debt when specifically scoped. |
| Known non-blocking debt | Two pre-existing red tests on `main` (`tests/unit/imports/artifact-storage-safety.test.ts`, `tests/unit/marketing/multi-business-selection.test.ts`); no CI test gate (open draft PR #3 addresses this and must be resolved before such a gate could be made required); pre-existing React-Compiler lint debt in `quick-appointment.tsx` / `sheet.tsx`; a 36px Employee-profile control below the Chasum ≥40px touch floor. |
| Exact next substantive gate | **PRODUCT OWNER CHAPTER SELECTION.** Live GitHub on 2026-09-26 shows no open issue representing authorized active engineering work: #73 CLOSED, #102 CLOSED, #81/#83/#72/#65 CLOSED, and the only open issue (#57) is deferred by Product Owner decision. The next substantive chapter is therefore a Product Owner decision, not an inferred continuation. Reconcile live GitHub before acting. |
| Product Owner input | **REQUIRED** to select the next chapter. No Product Owner input is required to complete this bounded continuity restamp. |

GVM Baby World and Chasum HQ remain normal tenants. Platform Admin / Control Centre remains a separate protected SaaS control plane at `/owner`; Chasum HQ is **not** Platform Admin.

## Permanent multi-tenant multi-location operating model

Governing architecture. GVM exposed the problem; **GVM is not the architecture.**

```
BUSINESS                → LOCATIONS
BUSINESS SERVICE CATALOG→ each Service may be offered at ONE / SOME / ALL Locations
STAFF                   → each Staff member may work at ONE / SOME / ALL Locations
STAFF ↔ SERVICE         → each Staff member may provide ONE / SOME / ALL Services
```

**Bookability at a selected Location requires all of:** Service offered there; Staff permitted to work there; Staff provides that Service; applicable hours / availability / operating rules.

- `service_locations` = offered-at operating truth. `staff_locations` = works-at operating truth. `staff_services` = provides operating truth. **Relationship tables carry operating truth.**
- Home/default Location is metadata/default behavior. It must **NOT** automatically mean "Staff can only work here."
- Primary/legacy Service Location (`services.location_id`) is metadata/compatibility state. It must **NOT** automatically mean "Service can only be offered here."
- Readiness is modelled in four states by `lib/booking/location-readiness.ts`: `no-services`, `no-staff`, `no-service-staff-overlap`, `ready`. Each names the actual missing relationship rather than showing a generic setup failure.

## Summer — AI Business Manager

Summer is the AI Business Manager / intelligence layer, maturing through:

**UNDERSTAND → EXPLAIN → RECOMMEND → ACT safely with permission → AUDIT → later AUTOMATE SAFELY → later OPERATE PROACTIVELY.**

Do not bolt an AI label onto conventional SaaS. Architect deterministic operating truth so Summer can safely operate across it.

For multi-location specifically: UNDERSTAND / EXPLAIN / RECOMMEND are now supported by explicit relationship truth and readiness states. **ACT remains constrained by the Employee assigned-location persistence gap below** — a deterministic additive write path is a prerequisite for Summer ACT on multi-location, not merely operator convenience.

## Permanent World-Class Standard

Durable Chasum acceptance lens. **Do not copy these products.**

| Reference | Quality Chasum must match |
| --- | --- |
| Apple | simplicity / clarity / polish |
| Stripe | truth / reliability / financial confidence |
| Linear | speed / hierarchy / efficient workflows |
| Notion | flexibility / adaptable business structure |
| OpenAI | intelligence |
| Framer | visual quality |
| Calendly | scheduling simplicity |
| Jane | workflow trust / usability |
| Fresha / Vagaro | operational breadth |

Standing question: **"If a mature service business sees Chasum beside its existing software, why does Chasum feel like an upgrade?"**

Hard principle: **passing tests means technically credible. It does NOT by itself mean world class.** Always ask both *"Does it work safely?"* **and** *"Would a real business prefer this experience to the mature software it already uses?"*

## Known product gap — Employee "Assigned locations" persistence

**Classification: IMPORTANT BUT POST-LAUNCH SAFE.** Recorded, not scheduled. Do not implement without authorization.

The Employee profile already contains an **"Assigned locations"** multi-select, pre-checked from current assignments. The problem is its persistence path in `lib/actions/employees.ts`:

- destructive delete-and-reinsert of `staff_locations`;
- destructive replacement behavior around `staff_services` in the same save flow;
- can write `staff.location_id`, i.e. can move home/default Location.

This creates safety and clarity risk. Genuinely additive actions exist but are unreachable for existing Staff at existing Locations: `assignStaffToLocation()` is reachable only from the Add Location dialog, and the additive path in `lib/actions/staff.ts` only runs on employee creation. The Services side is already correct — `enableServiceAtLocation()` is additive, idempotent and tenant-validated.

Likely future direction: make the existing control safely additive / explicit-remove rather than delete-all-and-reinsert; separate operating truth from home/default metadata clearly; design one deterministic write path that future bulk multi-location controls **and** Summer ACT can reuse.

## World-class UX observations to preserve

**Strength.** Chasum distinguishes `no-services`, `no-staff`, `no-service-staff-overlap` and `ready`, and explains the actual missing relationship rather than showing a generic setup failure.

**Gap.** Steady-state multi-location relationship truth is less visible once everything is configured — the model is mostly taught through empty states. The Employee profile also risks conceptual ambiguity between **Primary location**, **Default location** and **Assigned locations**; the operating/bookability truth must eventually be clearer.

These are observations, not authorized feature work.

## Major-chapter re-anchor

The World-Class / Mission / Summer / Competitive re-anchor should occur **ONCE PER MAJOR CHASUM CHAPTER** at the appropriate governing point. Do not repeatedly rerun broad strategic or competitor analysis every few hours.

Re-open the strategic review only when: new contradictory evidence appears; implementation materially diverges from the accepted contract; relevant competitive evidence is materially stale; or the Product Owner explicitly reconsiders a locked decision.

This preserves strategic consistency without creating development paralysis.

## Agent governance — current model

Do not blindly restore historical agent assignments if they are stale.

- **Darshan** — Founder / CEO / Product Owner.
- **ChatGPT** — Chasum AI Executive & Chief Product/Technology Adviser.
- **Claude Opus** — Development Control Tower.
- **Codex** — Primary Engineering Implementer.
- **Grok** — World-Class Product / Architecture Challenger.
- **Independent audit** — assigned separately according to risk.

One primary implementer per task. Claude becoming Development Control Tower does **not** automatically make Claude the normal implementation engineer. Live GitHub/repository/runtime truth remains authoritative over stale handoffs. Closed/accepted work stays closed absent contradictory evidence.

## Continue without reconstructing history

Read [Latest Handoff](handoffs/LATEST_HANDOFF.md), then [Environment Manifest](runtime/ENVIRONMENT_MANIFEST.md), then live GitHub Issues/PRs. Current GitHub/runtime evidence wins over stale handoff text.

**Size budget:** keep this board short; move history, not decisions, elsewhere.
