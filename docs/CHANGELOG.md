### Changed — Architecture Review

- Refactored staff, services, clients, and settings managers to shared patterns
- Replaced `window.location.reload()` with `router.refresh()` everywhere
- Public booking now uses RPCs (`upsert_booking_customer`, `create_public_appointment`)
- Public appointment reads via `get_public_appointments` RPC
- Settings hours form uses shared `WorkingHoursGrid`
- Calendar reschedule and delete actions show toasts instead of alerts
- Exported `ButtonProps` from button component

### Security

- Removed permissive anon SELECT/INSERT policies on `customers` and `appointments`
- Public PII access scoped through SECURITY DEFINER functions with business_id validation

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to 0.1.0

1. Pull latest `main`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Apply Supabase migrations in order:
   - `001_booking_engine.sql`
   - `002_booking_enhancements.sql`
   - `003_rls_hardening.sql`
4. Set environment variables per `.env.example`
5. Run `npm run build` to verify

### Breaking Changes

None for application code. Database migration `003` removes direct anon access to `customers` and `appointments` — public booking requires RPCs (already integrated in app code as of `f0ffaf7`).
