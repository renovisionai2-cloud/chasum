Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Changed (Public marketing website — Phase 3)

- Replaced static department previews with live interactive demos: animated charts, changing appointments, growing revenue, notifications, AI typing responses, and status updates (respects reduced motion)
- Added impact counters (Businesses, Appointments, Revenue, Hours saved, Countries), logo cloud placeholders, and an 8-story testimonial section with photo placeholders and results chips
- Soft page-load fade-in; dashboard previews animate into place; premium icon treatments on Platform modules; larger tour tap targets and more breathing room across sections
- Mobile-safe tour tabs (no horizontal page scroll); kept brand, auth, and dashboard app code untouched

### Changed (Public marketing website — Phase 2.2)

- Refined the existing visual system with a softly animated hero atmosphere, stronger type hierarchy, floating dashboard stage, animated statistics, trust badges, and smoother CTA interactions
- Upgraded the product tour to nine departments (Dashboard, AI Receptionist, CRM, Calendar, Employees, Business, Reports, Communication, Billing) with remembered selection, synchronized copy/benefits, and animated product-surface transitions
- Expanded department previews into larger, distinct dashboard surfaces based on the real Chasum product structure, including dedicated CRM, Communication, Reports, and Billing views
- Enlarged industry cards with industry-specific icons, premium hover motion, and retained expandable challenge/solution/module details
- Featured Emma as available today with a dedicated AI Receptionist experience; added avatars, specialties, availability, status, and descriptions for the planned AI workforce
- Added subtle navigation, comparison, pricing, card, and final-CTA micro-interactions while respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Changed (Public marketing website — Phase 2)

- Sticky glassmorphic nav with scroll spy, smooth section scrolling, and active-link highlighting
- Hero: animated stats, floating dashboard preview, primary Start Free / secondary Book Demo hierarchy

- Visual customer-journey timeline with connected steps through payment and reports
- Comparison table readability (sticky capability column, highlighted Chasum column); pricing/FAQ/final CTA polish with subtle motion
- Tasteful reveal/count-up/card-lift animations with `prefers-reduced-motion` respect; no auth or dashboard app changes

### Changed (Public marketing website — Phase 1)

- New sections: Trusted platform, Platform overview, interactive dashboard showcase, industries, customer journey, AI Workforce (Coming Soon), honest competitor comparison scaffold, expanded FAQ, stronger final CTA
- Kept brand colors, logo, typography, and pricing plans; presentational dashboard preview mirrors product UI without changing auth or dashboard code
- Updated marketing nav/footer anchors for the new structure

- Added `scripts/sync-supabase-email-templates.mjs` to configure Supabase confirmation and recovery email templates

### Production requirements (auth)

Authentication code is complete for development and staging. **Custom SMTP is the only remaining production requirement** before email confirmation and password reset can be verified end-to-end in production:

1. Configure custom SMTP in Supabase (recommended: [Resend](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-smtp)) — required on free-tier projects created after June 2026 to unlock auth email template editing
2. Run `node scripts/sync-supabase-email-templates.mjs` to apply token-hash callback templates
3. Verify signup, confirmation, login, and password reset against a real inbox

Resend is not configured yet; enable custom SMTP when ready for production testing.

### Added (Phase 4 — Core Scheduling Engine)

- Migration `005_phase4_scheduling_engine.sql`: unified `get_available_slots` and `validate_appointment_slot` RPCs, staff double-booking exclusion constraint, default staff hours seeding

- Settings UI for blocked time (business-wide or per-staff)
- `scripts/verify-phase4-scheduling.mjs` end-to-end scheduling verification (19 checks)

### Changed (Phase 4)

- Dashboard appointment form replaces manual date/time inputs with available slot selection
- Fixed migration `002` enum update that blocked `supabase db push` on PostgreSQL

### Planned (Phase 5)

- Stripe subscriptions and billing
- AI scheduling assistant
- Generated Supabase TypeScript types

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to 0.1.0

1. Pull latest `main`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Apply Supabase migrations in order:
   - `001_booking_engine.sql`
   - `002_booking_enhancements.sql`
   - `003_rls_hardening.sql`
4. Set environment variables per `.env.example`
5. Run `npm run build` to verify

### Breaking Changes

None for application code. Database migration `003` removes direct anon access to `customers` and `appointments` — public booking requires RPCs (already integrated in app code as of `f0ffaf7`).
